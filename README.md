**Font Awesome** is required for icons. Although you can skip it if you don't need icons in your UI, we recommend to use Fairway UI together with Font Awesome. Visit <a href="http://fontawesome.io">fontawesome.io</a> for the instruction. Some components, especially select input, require JavaScript as well.

```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://fairway-tech.github.io/fairway-ui/js/fairway-ui.min.js"></script>
```

Notice that **jQuery** is also a requirement. But, JavaScript are not necessary for other components. Other components including responsive menu are **CSS-only** components.

See our demo page for the usage example of each components.
